- 👋 Hi, I’m @LucasSosna
- 👀 I’m interested in programming in PHP (HTML/XHTML, CSS), JavaScript, C# and cycling.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning C# and libraries, especially Syncfusion, through which I build applications to be used on your own computer, not on the server as with PHP.
- 💞️ I’m looking to a sponsor so that I can continue writing applications. Especially when it comes to my health, it does not look good, I am after two head surgeries and because of that I will not pass the occupational health examination and therefore I cannot work. And in this way the circle is closed. If you are interested or know someone willing to contribute literally a very small amount every month I am open to contact.
- 📫 How to reach me: just send a letter to email: lukasz@lukasz.sos.pl or visit the website: http://en.lukasz.sos.pl
